    "# MCC (Matthews Correlation Coefficient)\n",
    "\n",
    "The MCC is in essence a correlation coefficient between the observed and predicted binary classifications; it returns a value between -1 and +1. A coefficient of +1 represents a perfect prediction, 0 no better than random prediction and -1 indicates total disagreement between prediction and observation. The statistic is also known as the phi coefficient. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthews_correlation_coefficient) \n",
    "\n",
    "The MCC is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{MCC} = \\frac{TP \\times TN - FP \\times FN}{\\sqrt{(TP + FP)(TP + FN)(TN + FP)(TN + FN)}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $TP$ is the number of true positives, $FP$ the number of false positives, $TN$ the number of true negatives and $FN$ the number of false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use case\n",
    "\n",
    "In applying MCC to our fruit classification dataset, the goal of our model is to develop an image recognition system that can automatically classify different types of fruits in real-time. The system should be able to distinguish between a variety of fruits with high accuracy.  "
